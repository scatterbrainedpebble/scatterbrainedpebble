- 👋 Hi, I’m @scatterbrainedpebble. I'm from the Netherlands.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, board games, language, and whatever hyperfocus I'm on at the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming and design, and writing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really. The world of open source still feels new and magical!
- 📫 How to reach me? For now, via GitHub. I'm still figuring things out.
